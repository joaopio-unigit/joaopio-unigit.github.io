## 📜 Bill Buddy AI  

**Bill Buddy AI** is an automated system that keeps you up to date with the latest activity in the U.S. Congress.  

### 🚀 Features  
- Retrieves **3 new federal bills daily** from official government sources.  
- Uses **OpenAI’s API** to generate clear, concise summaries of each bill.  
- Automatically **posts updates to GitHub Pages** for public access.  
- Runs fully automated using **GitHub Actions** and **CRON scheduling**.  

This project combines automation, natural language processing, and public transparency—making legislative updates more accessible and easier to understand.
